To align meta detectors, shower and rpc, the following should be done:

1. Create DSTs without magnetic field
2. Go to rpc or shower directory, depending on which detector you want to align
3. Compile the code, just type make, make install
4. Type ./showeralign or in rpc directory ./rpcalign
   To be provided (go inside macro, provide input and output directories ...):
   input:
         root files from above DSTs
         preliminary alignment file
   output: root file with ntuple
5. Go to the align directory:
6. Compile the code (make , make intsall)
7. Type ./align
   input:
          created root file with ntuple from previous procedure
          preliminary alignment file (the same like in ntuple creation)
   output:
          new alignment


          and have fun with the new Alignment!!!

          The results should be:
          before:  /|/\/\/\/\
