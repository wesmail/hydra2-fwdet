The folowing instruction assume that you will run
the scan in the checkout dir. if not, you have to care about
pathes.

1. svn checkout https://subversion.gsi.de/hades/hydra2/trunk/scripts/tools/diskmon diskmon
2. cd diskmon
3. . ./getSource.sh (copies Makefiles and hdiskspace.h/cc from repository)
4. edit defall.sh :  set HADDIR for install of libs
5. edit Makefile  :  set HADDIR to same as in defall.sh
6. build libs:
   . ./defall.sh
   make
   make install
7. edit runStat.sh :
      set  groupID for group quota
      set  isCompositeDir=yes (no: run disk in one shot, yes : catalogs will be proced per subdir, master catalog created, good for big projects)
      set  outdir and weboutdir, (default is subdir out and web inside diskmon dir)
      set  sourcedir             (to find the diskspace.C when runStat.sh is called from outside diskmon dir)
      set path to defall.sh      (default is ./defall.sh when running from inside dismon dir)
8. run  :  ./runStat.sh  mydirincludingpath leveltoprint 
   hint :  rootlogon.C should be used to load the lib, make
           sure it is found by root (HADES default search path includes current dir and HADDIR)
   If everything works out you should have root files  in outdir/mydirincludingpath and 
   figures+html in webout/mydirincludingpath
